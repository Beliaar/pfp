# pfp
pfp stands for pixelfarm project.

The intention is to create a farming simulation game (like harvest moon, stardew valley) which is primarily mouse controlled.
That is, the player will be moved by clicking with the mouse, and actions are being done by clicking on the fields/object.

This will probably be mostly a solo project, but if there is actually someone who wants to help, after reading that desription, they are free to do so.

Currently it is in a very, very, very, very, very early stage. The basic crop planting, watering and harvesting system is implemented, but there is no game around that, at this moment.
